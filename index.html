			<h2>Gibby is a Dog</h2>
			<p>Gibby is a rascal. She may be a dog, but she snorts and looks like a pig. She has a big lump on her side. Don't look at it. She is a Southern Belle rescued from the mean streets of Alabama. She was a fluffy dog and she still is a fluffy dog. She might always be a fluffy dog. </p>
			<h2>Wally is also a Dog</h2>
			<p>Wally is a handsome boy. He likes to lick faces, lick couches, lick his legs, and lick the hooves of dead creatures. Wally's real name is Walter, but he will also respond to Walnut, Waltrout, and Handsome Doggie. His bad breath is endearing. He is constantly reading <a href ="http://pitchfork.com/"> Pitchfork </a> </p>
